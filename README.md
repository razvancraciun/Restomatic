# Restomatic


## To do:
- Home page - including a list of restaurants
- Owner page(after login)
- Restaurant site sketches - havy
- Restaurant template
- ~~Fix register bug~~ DONE
- Colors to use for text/backgrounds/links - later?
- Restaurant add form - vague html
- Anything more??
- Form handling father class - i think the correct way would be to post everything to form.php and then
handle it according to type, see login.php for an example, not sure though, should aske the professor again?
